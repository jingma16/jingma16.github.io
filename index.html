<h2 class="style1">About Me</h2>
<ul>
I am a Data Scientist at Oath (formerly AOL.com).

In September 2016, I received a Ph.D. from the Department of Management 
Science and Engineering (Operations Research) at Stanford University. My thesis advisors were Prof. Erica Plambeck and Prof. Ram Rajagopal.<p>

I am interested in machine learning, statistics, optimization, online advertising, and operations management.
